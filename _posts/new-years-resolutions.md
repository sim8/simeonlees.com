Below are some things I aim to do, succeed, or improve at in 2023.

1. **Take more risks** - a little handwavey, but I believe in not getting too comfortable and what to challenge myself to take risks more freely this year.
2. **Commit to studying** - recently I've started the habit of starting each day spending some time studying topics or skills I feel would be beneficial for me. I deeply enjoy this time and would like to double down on this in the new year.
3. **Be more regimented** - related to the above, I think I have some to gain in a few areas of my life to committing to routine a bit more; particularly around sleep, exercise, and food.

Thanks for reading and hope you have a good one!
